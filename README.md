# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Similar to my Basic-Portfolio repository, this repo contains a "template", if you will, for your front-end. This is the Basic-Portfolio with a twist; it has been updated to include Bootstrap. Bootstrap is amazing because it includes a built-in grid system for your page layouts. There are also plenty of other Bootstrap templates avilable online for free. Just know that you must include the CDN links in the header in order for Bootstrap to work:

For more information on getting started, check out their docs (which are pretty good) here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/

If you want Bootstrap's cool back-end stuff to work, like modals or drop-down menus, you must also include a link to jQuery in the header of your index.html.


Take a look at my Basic-Portfolio repository if you want a simpler template that does not rely on Bootstrap: https://github.com/astlecha/Basic-Portfolio.

Feel free to contribute to this repository or let me know how I can improve it. Thanks!
